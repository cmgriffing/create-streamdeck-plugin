# ðŸš§ Development

Developing with CSDP is fairly simple. Simply run:

```
yarn dev:watch
```

This will listen for changes to the `public` and `src` folders. It then compiles the app using development settings for a faster iteration cycle. After that, it copies the results to your platform-specific Elgato StreamDeck plugins folder.
