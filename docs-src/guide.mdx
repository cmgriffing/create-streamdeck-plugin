# üó∫Ô∏è Getting Started

Here we will help guide you through the usage of the CLI tool.

## Running the command

To run the command we recommend using `npx`:

```
npx create-streamdeck-plugin
```

This will ensure that you are always running the latest version.

### Or Global

You can also install it globally, if you insist:

```
yarn global create-streamdeck-plugin
```

or

```
npm install -g create-streamdeck-plugin
```

Then just run it:

```
create-streamdeck-plugin
```

## The Interactive Steps

When running the command this tool currently only supports a guided creation process. In the future, it will allow an automated workflow via cli arguments.

### Step 1: Project Name

This value is used in various places. We handle various cases as needed for injecting the name within the app. eg: dasherized, camelCased, and PascalCased.

### Step 2: Project Path

The default value is dasherized form your project name as a subfolder of your current path. You can modify this value as you see fit. eg: Pointing at the current directory would be `./`

### Step 3: Project Features

At this step you can select some of the boilerplate that can be autofilled for you. OBS, Spotify, and more on the way.

### Step 4: Scaffolding Finished

Hooray! You are done. Navigate to the path you installed into in [Step 2](#step-2-project-path) and open your favorite editor.

See [Development](./development) for the next steps.
