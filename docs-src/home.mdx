# ![create-streamdeck-plugin logo](./gatsby-theme-docz/Logo/logo.svg) create-streamdeck-plugin

This CLI tool scaffolds out a starter plugin for the Elgato StreamDeck. Throughout these docs you will find it referenced as CSDP (C ~~reate-~~ S ~~tream~~ D ~~eck-~~ P ~~lugin~~).

## Why?

Copying and pasting or cloning the plugin example from Github does not give you the full process needed to build, test, and deploy a custom plugin.

## There Be ~~Dragons~~ React

This tool scaffold the plugin using a React based set of components and build processes. Those components can be found in this repo:
