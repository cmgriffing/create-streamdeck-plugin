# üõ•Ô∏è Distribution

To distribute the aplpication, you can run:

```
yarn export
```

This runs a production build and uses the official Streamdeck `DistributionTool` for your platform.

You can find these tools here as well if you would like to use them manually:

## Distribution On the Store

Elgato has an internal "store" within the StreamDeck software.

There is currently no Developer Portal for submitting to the store in an automated way. See here to stay up to date with Elgato's changes on this front:

## Distribution On Your Website

You are welcome to distribute the `.streamDeckPlugin` file on your own site.
